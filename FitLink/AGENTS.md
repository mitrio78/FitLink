# AGENTS.md ‚Äî FitLink iOS Project Guide for Agents

## üí° Project Overview
FitLink is an iOS fitness coaching app written in **SwiftUI** and organised with the **MVVM** architecture.  The project already includes screens for:

- TrainerDashboard
- ExerciseLibrary
- Schedule
- WorkoutSession
- Workouts
- Profile
- Main (tab bar container)

The repository structure is as follows:

```
FitLink/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App/                   # App entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CommonServices/        # Date formatter, in-memory stores, etc.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Helpers/               # Extensions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Localization/          # *.lproj folders with Localizable.strings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/                # Codable model definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Resources/             # Asset catalogs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Stubs/                 # Mock data generators
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Theme/                 # Colors, Typography, Spacing constants
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UIAtoms/               # Reusable UI components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/                 # Feature screens with View + ViewModel pairs
```

Each feature inside `Views/` has its own folder containing the SwiftUI `View` and its associated `ViewModel` (e.g. `Views/WorkoutSession/WorkoutSessionView.swift` and `WorkoutSessionViewModel.swift`).

## üìê Architectural Guidelines (MVVM)

- Every `View` must have a corresponding `ViewModel` located **in the same folder** and named `<Screen>ViewModel`.
- `ViewModel` classes **must**:
  - Be annotated with `@MainActor`.
  - Inherit from `ObservableObject`.
  - Expose state via `@Published` properties.
  - Keep all business logic (loading data, processing user actions, etc.).
- Views should remain declarative. Delegate logic from gestures or `.onAppear` to the ViewModel.
- Navigation state should be stored in the ViewModel as `@Published` optionals.
- Prefer `@StateObject` in Views to instantiate the ViewModel.
- Use Swift Concurrency (`async/await`) when performing asynchronous work. **TODO:** current code has no async calls ‚Äì update ViewModels to use async/await when networking or long operations are added.

---

## üß± UI Guidelines

- **Theme**: Use `Theme.color`, `Theme.font`, `Theme.spacing`, `Theme.radius` and `Theme.shadow` for all styling. Avoid hard‚Äëcoded colors or font sizes.
- Views should stay small. Extract subviews when a block grows beyond ~40 lines.
- Closing comments for UI containers should follow the style:

```swift
VStack {
    ...
} //: VStack
```

  **TODO:** existing code rarely uses these comments. New code should adopt them for consistency.

- Keep layout minimalistic and readable. Use built‚Äëin modifiers rather than custom ones when possible.
- **Bottom Sheets**: Keep vertical spacing minimal and match native system sheets. Avoid stacking multiple padding modifiers and prefer safe‚Äëarea‚Äëaware layout.

## View Structure Conventions

- Always use `List` for any vertically scrolling list of items where:
  - Each item is rendered with identical or similar structure (rows)
  - Swipe actions, selection, or reorder support is desired
  - You want performance optimizations like cell reuse

- Use `.listStyle(.plain)` by default to maintain visual control

- Use `ScrollView + LazyHGrid` or `LazyVGrid` for:
  - Horizontally scrollable rows (e.g. sets, metrics)
  - Complex nested layout
  - Non-uniform sizing or alignment

---

## üí¨ Localization

- All visible strings must come from `Localizable.strings`. Use `NSLocalizedString` or helper accessors.
- Example: `Text(NSLocalizedString("ExerciseLibrary.Header", comment: "Exercises"))`

---

## üìÅ Data & Services

- Models under `Models/` conform to `Codable` when persisted (e.g. `WorkoutSession`).
- `CommonServices/` contains small services like `DateFormatterService` and `WorkoutStore` (in‚Äëmemory store used in previews and feature screens).
- `Stubs/` holds factories such as `MockData` and `clientsMock` for previews and local testing.

### Temporary In-Memory AppDataStore

- Provides a centralized source of truth for all app data during development.
- All features must read and write data solely through `AppDataStore`.
- Only SwiftUI Previews may use mock data directly.
- This is a transitional mechanism to be replaced by a real data source like SwiftData or an API.

---

## üîå UIAtoms and Previews

- Reusable UI building blocks live in `UIAtoms/` (e.g. `ClientRow`, `SearchBarWithFilter`, components of the workout screen). Keep them simple and styling-consistent.
- Every view and atom should have SwiftUI `#Preview` definitions next to the implementation to aid design‚Äëtime testing.
---


## ‚úÖ Summary Checklist for New Code

1. Create a `View` and `ViewModel` pair in the same folder.
2. Annotate the `ViewModel` with `@MainActor` and expose state via `@Published`.
3. Keep business logic and navigation state in the ViewModel.
4. Use `Theme.*` constants for styling.
5. Localize all UI strings.
6. Extract subviews for large UI blocks.
7. Place `//: VStack` (etc.) closing comments after UI containers. *(TODO: enforce consistently)*
8. Provide a `#Preview` section for every View/Atom.

Following this guide will keep the FitLink codebase consistent and easy to maintain.

‚ùó Do not place formatting or business logic inside SwiftUI Views. Keep views declarative. Use extensions or ViewModels.
