## ‚úÖ Layout Overview

The screen is composed of **three main sections**:

- **–†–∞–∑–º–∏–Ω–∫–∞** (Warm-up)
- **–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è —á–∞—Å—Ç—å** (Main Set)
- **–ó–∞–º–∏–Ω–∫–∞** (Cool-down)

Each section contains a list of exercise blocks. There is **no inline expansion or edit mode** in this list.

## üß± Exercise Block Structure

Each exercise block (card) contains:

- **(Optional) Type label:** "–°—É–ø–µ—Ä—Å–µ—Ç", "–î—Ä–æ–ø—Å–µ—Ç", "–¶–∏—Ä–∫—É–ª"  
  - Style: small gray text above the title (`caption`, `textSecondary`)
- **Title:** Name of the exercise (or list of exercises if grouped)  
  - Truncated to 2 lines max  
  - Example: `"Pull-ups + Push-ups"`
- **Subtitle:** Summary of the set  
  - Example: `"3 –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥–∞ ¬∑ 10 –ø–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–π ¬∑ 50 –∫–≥"`

No images or icons are shown. Text only.
